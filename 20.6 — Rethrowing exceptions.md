# 20.6 — Rethrowing exceptions

Occasionally you may run into a case where you want to catch an exception, but not want to (or have the ability to) fully handle it at the point where you catch it. This is common when you want to log an error, but pass the issue along to the caller to actually handle.

有时候你可能想抓住一个异常（或者有能力抓住它），但是不想让异常在你这里就被消化掉，你想记录一个错误，然后再把异常交给真正解决异常的调用者

When a function can use a return code, this is simple. Consider the following example:

当一个函数可以返回一个返回值的时候，这是很简单的:

```
Database* createDatabase(std::string filename)
{
    try
    {
        Database *d = new Database(filename);
        d->open(); // assume this throws an int exception on failure
        return d;
    }
    catch (int exception)
    {
        // Database creation failed
        // Write an error to some global logfile
        g_log.logError("Creation of Database failed");
    }
 
    return nullptr;
}
```

In the above code snippet, the function is tasked with creating a Database object, opening the database, and returning the Database object. In the case where something goes wrong (e.g. the wrong filename is passed in), the exception handler logs an error, and then reasonably returns a null pointer.

在上面的代码中，函数正在创建一个数据库对象，打开一个数据库，返回一个数据库对象。如果有什么东西出了错，异常处理器会打印这个异常，函数然后返回一个空指针。

Now consider the following function:

```
int getIntValueFromDatabase(Database *d, std::string table, std::string key)
{
    assert(d);
 
    try
    {
        return d->getIntValue(table, key); // throws int exception on failure
    }
    catch (int exception)
    {
        // Write an error to some global logfile
        g_log.logError("doSomethingImportant failed");
 
        // However, we haven't actually handled this error
        // So what do we do here?
    }
}
```

In the case where this function succeeds, it returns an integer value -- any integer value could be a valid value.

But what about the case where something goes wrong with getIntValue()? In that case, getIntValue() will throw an integer exception, which will be caught by the catch block in getIntValueFromDatabase(), which will log the error. But then how do we tell the caller of getIntValueFromDatabase() that something went wrong? Unlike the top example, there isn’t a good return code we can use here (because any integer return value could be a valid one).

但是如果getIntValue出错了怎么办，在那种情况下getIntValue会抛出一个integer异常，然后会被getIntValueFromDatabase里面的try块抓住，然后catch块会记录一个错误。但是这样处理之后我们怎么告诉调用者有东西出错了呢？不像最上面那个例子一样，这里没有好的返回值可用。

#### **Throwing a new exception**

One obvious solution is to throw a new exception.

显然抛出新的异常是一个解决方案

```
int getIntValueFromDatabase(Database *d, std::string table, std::string key)
{
    assert(d);
 
    try
    {
        return d->getIntValue(table, key); // throws int exception on failure
    }
    catch (int exception)
    {
        // Write an error to some global logfile
        g_log.logError("doSomethingImportant failed");
 
        throw 'q'; // throw char exception 'q' up the stack to be handled by caller of getIntValueFromDatabase()
    }
}
```

In the example above, the program catches the int exception from getIntValue(), logs the error, and then throws a new exception with char value ‘q’. Although it may seem weird to throw an exception from a catch block, this is allowed. Remember, only exceptions thrown within a try block are eligible to be caught. This means that an exception thrown within a catch block will not be caught by the catch block it’s in. Instead, it will be propagated up the stack to the caller.

在上面的例子中，程序抓住了从getIntValue中抛出的异常，然后又在catch块中抛出了新的异常‘q’。尽管从catch块中抛出异常看起来有点奇怪。但这是可以的。记住，只有在try块中抛出的异常，try块才能抓住。在catch块中抛出的异常不会被上面的try块抓住，而是会向上传播给调用者。

The exception thrown from the catch block can be an exception of any type -- it doesn’t need to be the same type as the exception that was just caught.

**从catchky抛出的异常可以是任何类型的。不需要跟抓住的异常类型保持一致**

#### **Rethrowing an exception (the wrong way)**

Another option is to rethrow the same exception. One way to do this is as follows:

另一个选项是抛出相同的异常

```
int getIntValueFromDatabase(Database *d, std::string table, std::string key)
{
    assert(d);
 
    try
    {
        return d->getIntValue(table, key); // throws int exception on failure
    }
    catch (int exception)
    {
        // Write an error to some global logfile
        g_log.logError("doSomethingImportant failed");
 
        throw exception;
    }
}
```

Although this works, this method has a couple of downsides. First, this doesn’t throw the exact same exception as the one that is caught -- rather, it throws a copy-initialized copy of variable exception. Although the compiler is free to elide the copy, it may not, so this could be less performant.

尽管这能行，这个方法有几个缺点。首先，这和之前抓住的异常不是同一个，它抛出的其实是一份拷贝。尽管编译器可能会省略这份拷贝，但是也可能不会呀！所以这样做会性能不好

But significantly, consider what happens in the following case:

重要的是看看下面的例子

```
int getIntValueFromDatabase(Database *d, std::string table, std::string key)
{
    assert(d);
 
    try
    {
        return d->getIntValue(table, key); // throws Derived exception on failure
    }
    catch (Base &exception)
    {
        // Write an error to some global logfile
        g_log.logError("doSomethingImportant failed");
 
        throw exception; // Danger: this throws a Base object, not a Derived object
    }
}
```

In this case, getIntValue() throws a Derived object, but the catch block is catching a Base reference. This is fine, as we know we can have a Base reference to a Derived object. However, when we throw exception, the thrown exception is copy-initialized from variable exception. Variable exception has type Base, so the copy-initialized exception also has type Base (not Derived!). In other words, our Derived object has been sliced!

在这个例子中getIntValue抛出了异常，但是catch块抓住了的是一个基类的引用。这没啥问题，我们可以有一个基类引用指向一个派生类对象。**但是当我们抛出异常的时候，这个被抛出的异常是一个从抓住的基类引用拷贝出来的异常。换句话说，这里发生了对象的截断。**

You can see this in the following program:

```
#include <iostream>
class Base
{
public:
    Base() {}
    virtual void print() { std::cout << "Base"; }
};
 
class Derived: public Base
{
public:
    Derived() {}
    virtual void print() { std::cout << "Derived"; }
};
 
int main()
{
    try
    {
        try
        {
            throw Derived{};
        }
        catch (Base& b)
        {
            std::cout << "Caught Base b, which is actually a ";
            b.print();
            std::cout << "\n";
            throw b; // the Derived object gets sliced here
        }
    }
    catch (Base& b)
    {
        std::cout << "Caught Base b, which is actually a ";
        b.print();
        std::cout << "\n";
    }
 
    return 0;
}
```

This prints:

```
Caught Base b, which is actually a Derived
Caught Base b, which is actually a Base
```

The fact that the second line indicates that Base is actually a Base rather than a Derived proves that the Derived object was sliced.

你可以在这里看到，这个抛出来的异常其实是基类对象而不是派生类对象，在内层的catch块抛出异常时发生了对象截断。

#### **Rethrowing an exception (the right way)**

Fortunately, C++ provides a way to rethrow the exact same exception as the one that was just caught. To do so, simply use the throw keyword from within the catch block (with no associated variable), like so:

幸运的是C++提供了一种抛出和抓住的异常相同异常的办法。只需要写throw关键字，而后面不要跟任何的变量。

```
#include <iostream>
class Base
{
public:
    Base() {}
    virtual void print() { std::cout << "Base"; }
};
 
class Derived: public Base
{
public:
    Derived() {}
    virtual void print() { std::cout << "Derived"; }
};
 
int main()
{
    try
    {
        try
        {
            throw Derived{};
        }
        catch (Base& b)
        {
            std::cout << "Caught Base b, which is actually a ";
            b.print();
            std::cout << "\n";
            throw; // note: We're now rethrowing the object here
        }
    }
    catch (Base& b)
    {
        std::cout << "Caught Base b, which is actually a ";
        b.print();
        std::cout << "\n";
    }
 
    return 0;
}
```

This prints:

```
Caught Base b, which is actually a Derived
Caught Base b, which is actually a Derived
```

This throw keyword that doesn’t appear to throw anything in particular actually re-throws the exact same exception that was just caught. No copies are made, meaning we don’t have to worry about performance killing copies or slicing.

这个throw关键字看起来没抛出任何东西，而实际上做的事情是，重新抛出了和抓住的完全相同的异常。这里没有拷贝，意味着我们不需要考虑性能也不需要考虑对象截断。

If rethrowing an exception is required, this method should be preferred over the alternatives.

如果重新抛出一个异常是必要的话，这个方法应该是最优先使用的。

***Rule: When rethrowing the same exception, use the throw keyword by itself*.**
