# 18.1 — Pointers and references to the base class of derived objects

In the previous chapter, you learned all about how to use inheritance to derive new classes from existing classes. In this chapter, we are going to focus on one of the most important and powerful aspects of inheritance -- virtual functions.

在这一节我们会研究关于继承最重要和最强大的一面，虚函数。

But before we discuss what virtual functions are, let’s first set the table for why we need them.

在我们讨论虚函数是什么之前，我们先搞清楚我们为什么需要用虚函数。

In the chapter on [construction of derived classes](http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/113-order-of-construction-of-derived-classes/), you learned that when you create a derived class, it is composed of multiple parts: one part for each inherited class, and a part for itself.

在前面的章节中，你知道派生类对象是有几个部分的，一个部分是每一个被继承的基类，另一个部分就是派生类自己。

For example, here’s a simple case:

```
#include <string_view>
 
class Base
{
protected:
    int m_value;
 
public:
    Base(int value)
        : m_value{ value }
    {
    }
 
    std::string_view getName() const { return "Base"; }
    int getValue() const { return m_value; }
};
 
class Derived: public Base
{
public:
    Derived(int value)
        : Base{ value }
    {
    }
 
    std::string_view getName() const { return "Derived"; }
    int getValueDoubled() const { return m_value * 2; }
};
```

When we create a Derived object, it contains a Base part (which is constructed first), and a Derived part (which is constructed second). Remember that inheritance implies an is-a relationship between two classes. Since a Derived is-a Base, it is appropriate that Derived contain a Base part.

在我们创建派生类对象的时候，它包含了一个基类部分和一个派生类部分。注意继承表达的是一种类之间"is-a"的关系。所以派生类包含一个基类部分是合理的。

**Pointers, references, and derived classes**

It should be fairly intuitive that we can set Derived pointers and references to Derived objects:

直觉上我们可以给派生类对象设置指针和引用。

```
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    Derived derived{ 5 };
    std::cout << "derived is a " << derived.getName() << " and has value " << derived.getValue() << '\n';
 
    Derived &rDerived{ derived };
    std::cout << "rDerived is a " << rDerived.getName() << " and has value " << rDerived.getValue() << '\n';
 
    Derived *pDerived{ &derived };
    std::cout << "pDerived is a " << pDerived->getName() << " and has value " << pDerived->getValue() << '\n';
 
    return 0;
}
```

This produces the following output:

```
derived is a Derived and has value 5
rDerived is a Derived and has value 5
pDerived is a Derived and has value 5
```

However, since Derived has a Base part, a more interesting question is whether C++ will let us set a Base pointer or reference to a Derived object. It turns out, we can!

一个有趣的问题是，C++会不会让我们设置一个派生类对象中的基类部分的指针呢？答案是可以的。

```
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    Derived derived{ 5 };
 
    // These are both legal!
    Base &rBase{ derived };
    Base *pBase{ &derived };
 
    std::cout << "derived is a " << derived.getName() << " and has value " << derived.getValue() << '\n';
    std::cout << "rBase is a " << rBase.getName() << " and has value " << rBase.getValue() << '\n';
    std::cout << "pBase is a " << pBase->getName() << " and has value " << pBase->getValue() << '\n';
 
    return 0;
}
```

This produces the result:

```
derived is a Derived and has value 5
rBase is a Base and has value 5
pBase is a Base and has value 5
```

This result may not be quite what you were expecting at first!

结果可能跟你想象的不太一样

It turns out that because rBase and pBase are a Base reference and pointer, they can only see members of Base (or any classes that Base inherited). So even though Derived::getName() shadows (hides) Base::getName() for Derived objects, the Base pointer/reference can not see Derived::getName(). Consequently, they call Base::getName(), which is why rBase and pBase report that they are a Base rather than a Derived.

这两个指针和引用只能看到Base的成员，所以即便派生类中的getName掩盖了基类中的getName函数，但是这两个指向基类部分的指针和引用依然不能看到派生类中的getName，所以他们调用的是基类中的getName。这就是为什么他们报告说自己是基类而不是派生类的原因。（因为他们看不见派生类的成员）

Note that this also means it is not possible to call Derived::getValueDoubled() using rBase or pBase. They are unable to see anything in Derived.

这也意味着他们不能调用派生类的getValueDoubled函数，因为他们不能看见派生类中定义的任何东西。

Here’s another slightly more complex example that we’ll build on in the next lesson:

这里是一个更复杂的例子。

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>
#include <string>
 
class Animal
{
protected:
    std::string m_name;
 
    // We're making this constructor protected because
    // we don't want people creating Animal objects directly,
    // but we still want derived classes to be able to use it.
    Animal(std::string_view name)
        : m_name{ name }
    {
    }
    
    // To prevent slicing (covered later)
    Animal(const Animal&) = delete;
    Animal& operator=(const Animal&) = delete;
 
public:
    const std::string& getName() const { return m_name; }
    std::string_view speak() const { return "???"; }
};
 
class Cat: public Animal
{
public:
    Cat(std::string_view name)
        : Animal{ name }
    {
    }
 
    std::string_view speak() const { return "Meow"; }
};
 
class Dog: public Animal
{
public:
    Dog(std::string_view name)
        : Animal{ name }
    {
    }
 
    std::string_view speak() const { return "Woof"; }
};
 
int main()
{
    const Cat cat{ "Fred" };
    std::cout << "cat is named " << cat.getName() << ", and it says " << cat.speak() << '\n';
 
    const Dog dog{ "Garbo" };
    std::cout << "dog is named " << dog.getName() << ", and it says " << dog.speak() << '\n';
 
    const Animal *pAnimal{ &cat };
    std::cout << "pAnimal is named " << pAnimal->getName() << ", and it says " << pAnimal->speak() << '\n';
 
    pAnimal = &dog;
    std::cout << "pAnimal is named " << pAnimal->getName() << ", and it says " << pAnimal->speak() << '\n';
 
    return 0;
}
```

This produces the result:

```
cat is named Fred, and it says Meow
dog is named Garbo, and it says Woof
pAnimal is named Fred, and it says ???
pAnimal is named Garbo, and it says ???
```

We see the same issue here. Because pAnimal is an Animal pointer, it can only see the Animal portion of the class. Consequently, `pAnimal->speak()` calls Animal::speak() rather than the Dog::Speak() or Cat::speak() function.

我们在这看到了相同的问题。

**Use for pointers and references to base classes**

Now you might be saying, “The above examples seem kind of silly. Why would I set a pointer or reference to the base class of a derived object when I can just use the derived object?” It turns out that there are quite a few good reasons.

你有可能会说上面例子看起来有点傻。我为什么要设置一个基类指针指向派生类对象基类部分呢？原因是这样做有一些好处。

First, let’s say you wanted to write a function that printed an animal’s name and sound. Without using a pointer to a base class, you’d have to write it using overloaded functions, like this:

加上你想要写一个函数来打印动物的名字和声音，如果你不用基类指针的话，你就得写两个函数

```
void report(const Cat &cat)
{
    std::cout << cat.getName() << " says " << cat.speak() << '\n';
}
 
void report(const Dog &dog)
{
    std::cout << dog.getName() << " says " << dog.speak() << '\n';
}
```

Not too difficult, but consider what would happen if we had 30 different animal types instead of 2. You’d have to write 30 almost identical functions! Plus, if you ever added a new type of animal, you’d have to write a new function for that one too. This is a huge waste of time considering the only real difference is the type of the parameter.

虽然不难，但是如果你有很多的动物类型的话，你就得写很多遍这个函数。额外的，如果你新增一个动物类型，你又得写一个。这太浪费时间了。

However, because Cat and Dog are derived from Animal, Cat and Dog have an Animal part. Therefore, it makes sense that we should be able to do something like this:

然而，因为Cat和Dog是从Animal派生的，所以Cat和Dog有Animal的部分。因此我们应该让事情这么做。

```
void report(const Animal &rAnimal)
{
    std::cout << rAnimal.getName() << " says " << rAnimal.speak() << '\n';
}
```

This would let us pass in any class derived from Animal, even ones that we created after we wrote the function! Instead of one function per derived class, we get one function that works with all classes derived from Animal!

这允许我们传递任何的关于Animal的派生类给这个函数。即便是那些在写这个函数之后才开始写的类。不用每个类型都写一个函数，我们可以用一个函数来和许多的派生类工作的很好。

The problem is, of course, that because rAnimal is an Animal reference, `rAnimal.speak()` will call Animal::speak() instead of the derived version of speak().

问题在于，rAnimal是一个基类引用。所以speak函数会调用基类中的版本。

Second, let’s say you had 3 cats and 3 dogs that you wanted to keep in an array for easy access. Because arrays can only hold objects of one type, without a pointer or reference to a base class, you’d have to create a different array for each derived type, like this:

再就是，假设你有三个猫三个狗，你想把他们放到数组里面。因为数组只能容纳同类的元素。如果没有指向基类的指针，你必须自己为不同的派生类型创建不同的数组类型，向下面这样

```
#include <array>
#include <iostream>
 
// Cat and Dog from the example above
 
int main()
{
    const auto cats{ std::to_array<Cat>({{ "Fred" }, { "Misty" }, { "Zeke" }}) };
    const auto dogs{ std::to_array<Dog>({{ "Garbo" }, { "Pooky" }, { "Truffle" }}) };
    
    // Before C++20
    // const std::array<Cat, 3> cats{{ { "Fred" }, { "Misty" }, { "Zeke" } }};
    // const std::array<Dog, 3> dogs{{ { "Garbo" }, { "Pooky" }, { "Truffle" } }};
 
    for (const auto& cat : cats)
    {
        std::cout << cat.getName() << " says " << cat.speak() << '\n';
    }
 
    for (const auto& dog : dogs)
    {
        std::cout << dog.getName() << " says " << dog.speak() << '\n';
    }
 
    return 0;
}
```

Now, consider what would happen if you had 30 different types of animals. You’d need 30 arrays, one for each type of animal!

如果你有30个派生类型的话，你就得需要30个数组。每一个类型一个数组。

However, because both Cat and Dog are derived from Animal, it makes sense that we should be able to do something like this:

然而，因为Cat和Dog都是从Animal派生出来的，我们应该可以像下面这样做：

```
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    const Cat fred{ "Fred" };
    const Cat misty{ "Misty" };
    const Cat zeke{ "Zeke" };
 
    const Dog garbo{ "Garbo" };
    const Dog pooky{ "Pooky" };
    const Dog truffle{ "Truffle" };
 
    // Set up an array of pointers to animals, and set those pointers to our Cat and Dog objects
    const auto animals{ std::to_array<const Animal*>({&fred, &garbo, &misty, &pooky, &truffle, &zeke }) };
    
    // Before C++20, with the array size being explicitly specified
    // const std::array<const Animal*, 6> animals{ &fred, &garbo, &misty, &pooky, &truffle, &zeke };
    
    for (const auto animal : animals)
    {
        std::cout << animal->getName() << " says " << animal->speak() << '\n';
    }
 
    return 0;
}
```

While this compiles and executes, unfortunately the fact that each element of array “animals” is a pointer to an Animal means that `animal->speak()` will call Animal::speak() instead of the derived class version of speak() that we want. The output is

这个虽然能通过编译，也能运行，但是每一个数组中的动物在调用speak函数的时候，都会调用基类的而不调用派生类的。我们并不想要这样的结果

```
Fred says ???
Garbo says ???
Misty says ???
Pooky says ???
Truffle says ???
Zeke says ???
```

Although both of these techniques could save us a lot of time and energy, they have the same problem. The pointer or reference to the base class calls the base version of the function rather than the derived version. If only there was some way to make those base pointers call the derived version of a function instead of the base version…

尽管这个技巧可以节省我们很多的时间和经历，他们有相同的问题，这个指针和引用只能访问基类部分中的成员，而不能访问派生类中的版本。到底有没有办法让基类指针或者引用访问派生类部分的函数呢？

Want to take a guess what virtual functions are for? :)

你要猜一下吗？
