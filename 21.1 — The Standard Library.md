Congratulations! You made it all the way through the primary portion of the tutorial! In the preceding lessons, we covered many of the principal C++ language features (including a few from the C++11/14/17 extension to the language).

恭喜你，你已经把本基础教程的基础部分学完了。在前面我们已经介绍了很多主要的C++语言特性。

So the obvious question is, “what next?”. One thing you’ve probably noticed is that an awful lot of programs use the same concepts over and over again: loops, strings, arrays, sorting, etc… You’ve probably also noticed that writing programs using non-class versions of containers and common algorithms are error-prone. The good news is that C++ comes with a library that is chock full of reusable classes for you to build programs out of. This library is called The C++ Standard Library.

所以现在的问题是，下面干什么？您可能已经注意到的一件事是：很多程序一遍又一遍地使用相同的概念：循环，字符串，数组，排序等……，你可能还注意到了使用非类版本的容器和常见的算法容易出错。 好消息是C ++附带了一个库，里面塞满了供你写程序可以重复使用的类。 称为C ++标准库。

### **The Standard Library**

The Standard library contains a collection of classes that provide templated containers, algorithms, and iterators. If you need a common class or algorithm, odds are the standard library has it. The upside is that you can take advantage of these classes without having to write and debug the classes yourself, and the standard library does a good job providing reasonably efficient versions of these classes. The downside is that the standard library is complex, and can be a little intimidating since everything is templated.

标准库库包含了一个模板容器，算法和迭代器的类的集合。 如果你需要通用的类或算法，则标准库里面很可能就已经有了。 好处是你可以利用这些类，而不必自己编写和调试这样的类，并且标准库在提供这些类的合理有效版本方面做得很好。 缺点是标准库很复杂，而且因为所有内容都是模板化的，所以看起来可能有点吓人。

Fortunately, you can bite off the standard library in tiny pieces, using only what you need from it, and ignore the rest until you’re ready to tackle it.

幸运的是，您可以只使用标准库中你所需要的内容，而不要管其余内容，直到你有一天能处理那些内容。

In the next few lessons, we’ll take a high-level look at the types of containers, algorithms, and iterators that the standard library provides. Then in subsequent lessons, we’ll dig into some of the specific classes.

在接下来的几课中，我们将对标准库提供的容器，算法和迭代器的类型进行高层次的研究。 在随后的课程中，我们将深入探讨一些特定的类。
