# 18.11 — Printing inherited classes using operator<<

Consider the following program that makes use of a virtual function:

思考下面了虚函数的代码

```
class Base
{
public:
	virtual void print() const { std::cout << "Base";  }
};
 
class Derived : public Base
{
public:
	virtual void print() const override { std::cout << "Derived"; }
};
 
int main()
{
	Derived d{};
	Base &b{ d };
	b.print(); // will call Derived::print()
 
	return 0;
}
```

By now, you should be comfortable with the fact that b.print() will call Derived::print() (because b is pointing to a Derived class object, Base::print() is a virtual function, and Derived::print() is an override).

你现在应该很容易就能知道b.print会调用派生类的print，因为b是指向派生类对象的，而print是一个函数，所以虚表里面的函数指针指向了派生类的print重写函数。

While calling member functions like this to do output is okay, this style of function doesn’t mix well with std::cout:

当调用的时候没有问题，这种函数和stdcout混合使用的不好看

```
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	Derived d{};
	Base &b{ d };
 
        std::cout << "b is a ";
        b.print(); // messy, we have to break our print statement to call this function
        std::cout << '\n';
 
	return 0;
}
```

In this lesson, we’ll look at how to override operator<< for classes using inheritance, so that we can use operator<< as expected, like this:

在本节，我们会看一下怎么去重写流输出运算符，这样的话我们就能让流输出运行的符合我们的意图。

```
std::cout << "b is a " << b << '\n'; // much better
```

#### **The challenges with operator<<**

Let’s start by overloading operator<< in the typical way:

让我们现在先写一个基本的流输出。

```
#include <iostream>
class Base
{
public:
	virtual void print() const { std::cout << "Base";  }
 
	friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream &out, const Base &b)
        {
            out << "Base";
            return out;
        }
};
 
class Derived : public Base
{
public:
	virtual void print() const override { std::cout << "Derived"; }
 
	friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream &out, const Derived &d)
        {
            out << "Derived";
            return out;
        }
 
};
 
int main()
{
    Base b{};
    std::cout << b << '\n';
 
    Derived d{};
    std::cout << d << '\n';
 
    return 0;
}
```

Because there is no need for virtual function resolution here, this program works as we’d expect, and prints:

因为main这里没有虚函数的必要，这个函数的输出会和我们期待的一致。

```
Base
Derived
```

Now, consider the following main() function instead:

现在思考一下下面的main函数。

```
int main()
{
    Derived d{};
    Base &bref{ d };
    std::cout << bref << '\n';
    
    return 0;
}
```

This program prints:

```
Base
```

That’s probably not what we were expecting. This happens because our version of operator<< that handles Base objects isn’t virtual, so std::cout << bref calls the version of operator<< that handles Base objects rather than Derived objects.

这可能就不是我们期待的了。这是因为这个重载函数不是虚函数

Therein lies the challenge.

#### **Can we make Operator << virtual?**

If this issue is that operator<< isn’t virtual, can’t we simply make it virtual?

如果问题是因为流输出运算符，我们能把它变成虚函数吗？

The short answer is no. There are a number of reasons for this.

当然不行，有几个原因：

First, only member functions can be virtualized -- this makes sense, since only classes can inherit from other classes, and there’s no way to override a function that lives outside of a class (you can overload non-member functions, but not override them). Because we typically implement operator<< as a friend, and friends aren’t considered member functions, a friend version of operator<< is ineligible to be virtualized. (For a review of why we implement operator<< this way, please revisit lesson [13.5 -- Overloading operators using member functions](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/overloading-operators-using-member-functions/)).

首先只有成员函数可以被说明成虚函数，这说的过去，因为只有成员函数才可以给子类继承，就没有办法去重写一个在继承链外面的函数（你可以重载，但是你不能重写）。因为我们实际上是在把流输出运算符重载函数当成外部的友元函数，一个友元版本的流输出运算符重载函数是不能被设置成虚函数的。

Second, even if we could virtualize operator<< there’s the problem that the function parameters for Base::operator<< and Derived::operator<< differ (the Base version would take a Base parameter and the Derived version would take a Derived parameter). Consequently, the Derived version wouldn’t be considered an override of the Base version, and thus be ineligible for virtual function resolution.

第二，如果我们可以将流输出运算符说明成虚函数也会有问题。派生类版本的函数和基类版本的函数参数不一样。因此派生类的函数不能作为是对基类函数的重写，所以变成虚函数也是不合格的。

So what’s a programmer to do?

所以程序员要怎么办（程序员好难 sad）

#### **The solution**

The answer, as it turns out, is surprisingly simple.

答案却很简单

First, we set up operator<< as a friend in our base class as usual. But instead of having operator<< do the printing itself, we delegate that responsibility to a normal member function that *can* be virtualized!

首先我们将让在基类的那个友元函数保持那样，但是不要让他直接输出，我们把这个事情委托给一个可以变成虚函数的成员函数。

Here’s the full solution that works:

```c++
#include <iostream>
class Base
{
public:
	// Here's our overloaded operator<<
	friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream &out, const Base &b)
	{
		// Delegate printing responsibility for printing to member function print()
		return b.print(out);
	}
 
	// We'll rely on member function print() to do the actual printing
	// Because print is a normal member function, it can be virtualized
	virtual std::ostream& print(std::ostream& out) const
	{
		out << "Base";
		return out;
	}
};
 
class Derived : public Base
{
public:
	// Here's our override print function to handle the Derived case
	virtual std::ostream& print(std::ostream& out) const override
	{
		out << "Derived";
		return out;
	}
};
 
int main()
{
	Base b{};
	std::cout << b << '\n';
 
	Derived d{};
	std::cout << d << '\n'; // note that this works even with no operator<< that explicitly handles Derived objects
 
	Base &bref{ d };
	std::cout << bref << '\n';
 
	return 0;
}
```

The above program works in all three cases:

```
Base
Derived
Derived
```

Let’s examine how in more detail.

让我们详细的看一下其中的细节

First, in the Base case, we call operator<<, which calls virtual function print(). Since our Base reference parameter points to a Base object, b.print() resolves to Base::print(), which does the printing. Nothing too special here.

在Base的运算符重载函数中，调用了一个虚函数，因为爱我们的Base引用指向Base对象，所以打印一个Base出来，这里没什么稀奇。

In the Derived case, the compiler first looks to see if there’s an operator<< that takes a Derived object. There isn’t one, because we didn’t define one. Next the compiler looks to see if there’s an operator<< that takes a Base object. There is, so the compiler does an implicit upcast of our Derived object to a Base& and calls the function (we could have done this upcast ourselves, but the compiler is helpful in this regard). This function then calls virtual print(), which resolves to Derived::print().

在派生类中，编译器首先查看有没有流输出运算符接受一个Derived对象，没有这个函数，因为我们本来就没有定义，然后编译器去看有没有流输出运算符接受一个基类对象，答案是确实有。所以编译器做了一个隐式的向上造型，把派生类对象转换成了基类引用，然后调用了这个运算符重载函数，最后解析到了派生类对象的print函数。

Note that we don’t need to define an operator<< for each derived class! The version that handles Base objects works just fine for both Base objects and any class derived from Base!

**注意我们不需要为每个派生类定义一个流输出运算符重载函数**，基类的版本对所有的基类和派生类都起作用。

The third case proceeds as a mix of the first two. First, the compiler matches variable bref with operator<< that takes a Base. That calls our virtual print() function. Since the Base reference is actually pointing to a Derived object, this resolves to Derived::print(), as we intended.

第三个案例是前面两个的混合，首先编译器匹配bref和这个流输出运算符，然后调用了虚函数print，因为bref实际上指向一个派生类对象，所以print解析到了派生类对象的print，跟我们想的一样。

Problem solved.
