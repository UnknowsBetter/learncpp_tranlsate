# 17.2 — Basic inheritance in C++

Now that we’ve talked about what inheritance is in an abstract sense, let’s talk about how it’s used within C++.

我们现在谈一下怎么在C++中使用继承

Inheritance in C++ takes place between classes. In an inheritance (is-a) relationship, the class being inherited from is called the **parent class**, **base class**, or **superclass**, and the class doing the inheriting is called the **child class**, **derived class**, or **subclass**.

继承在C++中，发生在类与类之间。被继承的类叫做父类，基类或者是上级类。继承的类叫做子类，派生类或者下级类。

In the above diagram, Fruit is the parent, and both Apple and Banana are children.

![img](http://learncpp.com/images/CppTutorial/Section11/ShapesInheritance.gif)

In this diagram, Triangle is both a child (to Shape) and a parent (to Right Triangle).

A child class inherits both behaviors (member functions) and properties (member variables) from the parent (subject to some access restrictions that we’ll cover in a future lesson).

一个子类继承了父类的行为和属性。

These variables and functions become members of the derived class.

这些变量和函数成为派生类的成员。

Because child classes are full-fledged classes, they can (of course) have their own members that are specific to that class. We’ll see an example of this in a moment.

子类是成熟的类，他们当然也可以有他们自己的特定的成员。

#### **A Person class**

Here’s a simple class to represent a generic person:

```
#include <string>
 
class Person
{
// In this example, we're making our members public for simplicity
public: 
    std::string m_name{};
    int m_age{};
 
    Person(const std::string& name = "", int age = 0)
        : m_name{ name }, m_age{ age }
    {
    }
 
    const std::string& getName() const { return m_name; }
    int getAge() const { return m_age; }
 
};
```

Because this Person class is designed to represent a generic person, we’ve only defined members that would be common to any type of person. Every person (regardless of gender, profession, etc…) has a name and age, so those are represented here.

因为这个Person类被设计为定义普通的人，所以我们只定义了对于所有类型的人来说共有的属性。每个人都有名字和年龄，所以他们在这里出现了。

Note that in this example, we’ve made all of our variables and functions public. This is purely for the sake of keeping these examples simple right now. Normally we would make the variables private. We will talk about access controls and how those interact with inheritance later in this chapter.

注意到在这个例子中我们把我们所有的变量和函数都设为Public，这是纯为了让这些例子尽量简单。通常我们会把变量设置为private，我们将会谈论访问控制和一些继承与访问控制的相关联的东西，在本章的末尾的时候。

#### **A BaseballPlayer class**

Let’s say we wanted to write a program that keeps track of information about some baseball players. Baseball players need to contain information that is specific to baseball players -- for example, we might want to store a player’s batting average, and the number of home runs they’ve hit.

假设我们现在想写一个程序来跟踪棒球运动员的信息。棒球运动员需要包含一些对于棒球运动员而言才有的属性。举个例子，我们可能想存储一个的运动员的平均击球次数以及他们击中的全垒打次数。

Here’s our incomplete Baseball player class:

```
class BaseballPlayer
{
// In this example, we're making our members public for simplicity
public:
    double m_battingAverage{};
    int m_homeRuns{};
 
    BaseballPlayer(double battingAverage = 0.0, int homeRuns = 0)
       : m_battingAverage{battingAverage}, m_homeRuns{homeRuns}
    {
    }
};
```

Now, we also want to keep track of a baseball player’s name and age, and we already have that information as part of our Person class.

现在我们想追踪运动员的名字和年龄，我们在person类中已经定义好了。

We have three choices for how to add name and age to BaseballPlayer:

给运动员添加名称和年龄我们有三个选择。

1) Add name and age to the BaseballPlayer class directly as members. This is probably the worst choice, as we’re duplicating code that already exists in our Person class. Any updates to Person will have to be made in BaseballPlayer too.

直接给BaseballPlayer添加名字和年龄。这可能是最坏的选择，我们在重复一些已经写过的代码，对于Person的一些更新也要给BaseballPlayer写一份。

2) Add Person as a member of BaseballPlayer using composition. But we have to ask ourselves, “does a BaseballPlayer have a Person”? No, it doesn’t. So this isn’t the right paradigm.

添加Person作为BaseBallPlayer的成员。但是我们必须要问自己一个问题，“足球运动员拥有一个人吗？”。所以这不是正确的范例（不应该这么写代码）。

3) Have BaseballPlayer inherit those attributes from Person. Remember that inheritance represents an is-a relationship. Is a BaseballPlayer a Person? Yes, it is. So inheritance is a good choice here.

让足球运动员继承Person的属性。继承表达的是is-a的关系。一个足球运动员是一个人吗？是的，所以继承在这里是一个好的选择。

#### **Making BaseballPlayer a derived class**

To have BaseballPlayer inherit from our Person class, the syntax is fairly simple. After the `class BaseballPlayer` declaration, we use a colon, the word “public”, and the name of the class we wish to inherit. This is called *public inheritance*. We’ll talk more about what public inheritance means in a future lesson.

为了让BaseballlPlayer从Preson类中继承。这个语法是相当简单的。在class BaseballPlayer后面我们用一个冒号，一个关键词public然后跟上我们那个了被继承的类的名字。

这样做叫public继承。我们会在讨论public继承的意义时探讨关于此的更多东西。

```
// BaseballPlayer publicly inheriting Person
class BaseballPlayer : public Person
{
public:
    double m_battingAverage{};
    int m_homeRuns{};
 
    BaseballPlayer(double battingAverage = 0.0, int homeRuns = 0)
       : m_battingAverage{battingAverage}, m_homeRuns{homeRuns}
    {
    }
};
```

Using a derivation diagram, our inheritance looks like this:

用一个派生图来表达的话，向下面这样

![img](http://www.learncpp.com/images/CppTutorial/Section11/BaseballPlayerInheritance.gif)

When BaseballPlayer inherits from Person, BaseballPlayer acquires the member functions and variables from Person. Additionally, BaseballPlayer defines two members of its own: m_battingAverage and m_homeRuns. This makes sense, since these properties are specific to a BaseballPlayer, not to any Person.

当一个足球运动员继承了Person的时候，足球运动员获取了Person的函数和成员变量。额外的，排球运动员定义了两个自己的成员。这很有意义，因为有一些属性就是只有排球运动员才有的。

Thus, BaseballPlayer objects will have 4 member variables: m_battingAverage and m_homeRuns from BaseballPlayer, and m_name and m_age from Person.

因此一个足球运动员会有4个成员变量。

This is easy to prove:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
class Person
{
public:
    std::string m_name{};
    int m_age{};
 
    Person(const std::string& name = "", int age = 0)
        : m_name{name}, m_age{age}
    {
    }
 
    const std::string& getName() const { return m_name; }
    int getAge() const { return m_age; }
 
};
 
// BaseballPlayer publicly inheriting Person
class BaseballPlayer : public Person
{
public:
    double m_battingAverage{};
    int m_homeRuns{};
 
    BaseballPlayer(double battingAverage = 0.0, int homeRuns = 0)
       : m_battingAverage{battingAverage}, m_homeRuns{homeRuns}
    {
    }
};
 
int main()
{
    // Create a new BaseballPlayer object
    BaseballPlayer joe{};
    // Assign it a name (we can do this directly because m_name is public)
    joe.m_name = "Joe";
    // Print out the name
    std::cout << joe.getName() << '\n'; // use the getName() function we've acquired from the Person base class
 
    return 0;
}
```

Which prints the value:

```
Joe
```

This compiles and runs because joe is a BaseballPlayer, and all BaseballPlayer objects have a m_name member variable and a getName() member function inherited from the Person class.

#### **An Employee derived class**

Now let’s write another class that also inherits from Person. This time, we’ll write an Employee class. An employee “is a” person, so using inheritance is appropriate:

现在我们实现另一个从Person中继承的派生类。在这一次，我们写一个雇员类。一个的雇员是一个人，所以使用继承关系是合适的。

```
// Employee publicly inherits from Person
class Employee: public Person
{
public:
    double m_hourlySalary{};
    long m_employeeID{};
 
    Employee(double hourlySalary = 0.0, long employeeID = 0)
        : m_hourlySalary{hourlySalary}, m_employeeID{employeeID}
    {
    }
 
    void printNameAndSalary() const
    {
        std::cout << m_name << ": " << m_hourlySalary << '\n';
    }
};
```

Employee inherits m_name and m_age from Person (as well as the two access functions), and adds two more member variables and a member function of its own. Note that printNameAndSalary() uses variables both from the class it belongs to (Employee::m_hourlySalary) and the parent class (Person::m_name).

雇员从Person中继承了name和age，而且还添加了两个变量。注意打印薪水的函数中，既使用了来自雇员的变量也使用了来自Person的变量。

This gives us a derivation chart that looks like this:

![img](http://www.learncpp.com/images/CppTutorial/Section11/EmployeeInheritance.gif)

Note that Employee and BaseballPlayer don’t have any direct relationship, even though they both inherit from Person.

注意即便雇员和运动员继承了同一个基类，但是他们两之间没有任何的直接关系。

Here’s a full example using Employee:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
class Person
{
public:
    std::string m_name{};
    int m_age{};
 
    const std::string& getName() const { return m_name; }
    int getAge() const { return m_age; }
 
    Person(const std::string& name = "", int age = 0)
        : m_name{name}, m_age{age}
    {
    }
};
 
// Employee publicly inherits from Person
class Employee: public Person
{
public:
    double m_hourlySalary{};
    long m_employeeID{};
 
    Employee(double hourlySalary = 0.0, long employeeID = 0)
        : m_hourlySalary{hourlySalary}, m_employeeID{employeeID}
    {
    }
 
    void printNameAndSalary() const
    {
        std::cout << m_name << ": " << m_hourlySalary << '\n';
    }
};
 
int main()
{
    Employee frank{20.25, 12345};
    frank.m_name = "Frank"; // we can do this because m_name is public
 
    frank.printNameAndSalary();
    
    return 0;
}
```

This prints:

```
Frank: 20.25
```

#### **Inheritance chains**

It’s possible to inherit from a class that is itself derived from another class. There is nothing noteworthy or special when doing so -- everything proceeds as in the examples above.

继承一个本身就继承了别人的类是有可能的。没什么值得注意和需要多做的事情。

For example, let’s write a Supervisor class. A Supervisor is an Employee, which is a Person. We’ve already written an Employee class, so let’s use that as the base class from which to derive Supervisor:

举个例子，我们写了一个督察的类，督察是一个雇员，雇员是一个人。我们已经写了雇员类，我们让它作为督察类的基类。

```
class Supervisor: public Employee
{
public:
    // This Supervisor can oversee a max of 5 employees
    long m_overseesIDs[5]{};
};
```

Now our derivation chart looks like this:


![img](http://www.learncpp.com/images/CppTutorial/Section11/SupervisorInheritance.gif)



All Supervisor objects inherit the functions and variables from both Employee and Person, and add their own m_overseesIDs member variable.

By constructing such inheritance chains, we can create a set of reusable classes that are very general (at the top) and become progressively more specific at each level of inheritance.

#### **Why is this kind of inheritance useful?**

为什么这种类型的继承是有用的呢？

Inheriting from a base class means we don’t have to redefine the information from the base class in our derived classes. We automatically receive the member functions and member variables of the base class through inheritance, and then simply add the additional functions or member variables we want. This not only saves work, but also means that if we ever update or modify the base class (e.g. add new functions, or fix a bug), all of our derived classes will automatically inherit the changes!

继承使我们不需要在派生类中定义已有的东西。我们自动接收了从基类中获取到的成员变量和函数，只需要简单的添加我们想要的一些额外的功能和成员变量。这不仅仅简化了工作，而且还意味着如果我们更新基类的话，或是添加一个新的功能，或是修改一下bug，所有的派生类都可以自动发生改变。

For example, if we ever added a new function to Person, both Employee and Supervisor would automatically gain access to it. If we added a new variable to Employee, Supervisor would also gain access to it. This allows us to construct new classes in an easy, intuitive, and low-maintenance way!

#### **Conclusion**

Inheritance allows us to reuse classes by having other classes inherit their members. In future lessons, we’ll continue to explore how this works.

继承使我们能重用代码。在将来的课程中，我们会继续探索这个事情是怎么工作的。
