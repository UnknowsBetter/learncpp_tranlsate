# 20.7 — Function try blocks

Try and catch blocks work well enough in most cases, but there is one particular case in which they are not sufficient. Consider the following example:

try catch在大部分情况下够用了。但是有一个情况下，它还不够用，思考下面的例子

```
class A
{
private:
	int m_x;
public:
	A(int x) : m_x(x)
	{
		if (x <= 0)
			throw 1;
	}
};
 
class B : public A
{
public:
	B(int x) : A(x)
	{
		// What happens if creation of A fails and we want to handle it here?
	}
};
 
int main()
{
	try
	{
		B b(0);
	}
	catch (int)
	{
		std::cout << "Oops\n";
	}
}
```

In the above example, derived class B calls base class constructor A, which can throw an exception. Because the creation of object b has been placed inside a try block (in function main()), if A throws an exception, main’s try block will catch it. Consequently, this program prints:

在上面的例子中，A的构造函数抛出异常，B的构造函数没有处理，所以异常传播的main里面，然后就打印出了Oops

```
Oops
```

But what if we want to catch the exception inside of B? The call to base constructor A happens via the member initialization list, before the B constructor’s body is called. There’s no way to wrap a standard try block around it.

但如果我们想在B里面抓住异常的话，怎么做？到成员A基类构造函数的调用时通过初始化列表进行的。在B构造函数的函数体之前。没有办法来用一个标准的try块把它抓住。

In this situation, we have to use a slightly modified try block called a **function try block**.

在这种情况下，我们要使用try块修改版，叫做**function try block**

#### **Function try blocks**

Function try blocks are designed to allow you to establish an exception handler around the body of an entire function, rather than around a block of code.

Function try blocks 被设计来允许你创建一个特别的异常处理器。这个异常处理器可以环绕整个函数，而不仅仅是几行语句形成的代码块。

The syntax for function try blocks is a little hard to describe, so we’ll show by example:

这个东西的语法难以名状，所以直接看例子把：

```
#include <iostream>
 
class A
{
private:
	int m_x;
public:
	A(int x) : m_x(x)
	{
		if (x <= 0)
			throw 1;
	}
};
 
class B : public A
{
public:
	B(int x) try : A(x) // note addition of try keyword here
	{
	}
	catch (...) // note this is at same level of indentation as the function itself
	{
                // Exceptions from member initializer list or constructor body are caught here
 
                std::cerr << "Exception caught\n";
 
                // If an exception isn't explicitly thrown here, the current exception will be implicitly rethrown
	}
};
 
int main()
{
	try
	{
		B b(0);
	}
	catch (int)
	{
		std::cout << "Oops\n";
	}
}
```

When this program is run, it produces the output:

当这个函数运行的时候，它会产生下面的输出：

```
Exception caught
Oops
```

Let’s examine this program in more detail.

我们详细说明一下这个函数

First, note the addition of the “try” keyword before the member initializer list. This indicates that everything after that point (until the end of the function) should be considered inside of the try block.

首先要注意到try关键字放到了成员初始化列表的前面，函数参数列表的后面。这意味从try开始的那个点（直到函数的结束），应该被认为是try块的范围。

Second, note that the associated catch block is at the same level of indentation as the entire function. Any exception thrown between the try keyword and the end of the function body will be eligible to be caught here.

第二，注意到关联的catch块的缩进层级和函数的层级是一样的。从上面的try块中抛出的所有异常，都可以在这个catch中被抓住。

Finally, unlike normal catch blocks, which allow you to either resolve an exception, throw a new exception, or rethrow an existing exception, with function-level try blocks, you must throw or rethrow an exception. If you do not explicitly throw a new exception, or rethrow the current exception (using the throw keyword by itself), the exception will be implicitly rethrown up the stack.

第三，跟普通catch块不一样的是，普通的catch块允许你在这里解决异常，重新抛出异常，或者直接抛出这个异常。**在这个function-level的try块中，你必须得重新抛出异常**，如果你不明确的抛出一个异常的话，抓住的异常会被重新抛出。

In the program above, because we did not explicitly throw an exception from the function-level catch block, the exception was implicitly rethrown, and was caught by the catch block in main(). This is the reason why the above program prints “Oops”!

在上面的程序中，我们没有明确抛出一个异常，所以抓住的异常被重新抛出，这是上面打印Oops的原因。

**Although function level try blocks can be used with non-member functions as well, they typically aren’t because there’s rarely a case where this would be needed. They are almost exclusively used with constructors!**

**尽管funciton level的tryky也可以用在非成员函数上，但是通常都没有这个必要这样做。基本上只是在构造函数中用这个东西。**

#### **Function try blocks can catch both base and the current class exceptions**

In the above example, if either A or B’s constructor throw an exception, it will be caught by the try block around B’s constructor.

上面的例子中，如果A或者B的构造函数抛出了一个异常，会被B的构造函数的try块抓住。

We can see that in the following example, where we’re throwing an exception from class B instead of class A:

我们可以看一下下面的例子，我们从B里面抛出了一个异常，而不是从A抛出异常。

```
#include <iostream>
 
class A
{
private:
	int m_x;
public:
	A(int x) : m_x(x)
	{
	}
};
 
class B : public A
{
public:
	B(int x) try : A(x) // note addition of try keyword here
	{
		if (x <= 0) // moved this from A to B
			throw 1; // and this too
	}
	catch (...)
	{
                std::cerr << "Exception caught\n";
 
                // If an exception isn't explicitly thrown here, the current exception will be implicitly rethrown
	}
};
 
int main()
{
	try
	{
		B b(0);
	}
	catch (int)
	{
		std::cout << "Oops\n";
	}
}
```

We get the same output:

```
Exception caught
Oops
```

#### **Don’t use function try to clean up resources**

When construction of an object fails, the destructor of the class is not called. Consequently, you may be tempted to use a function try block as a way to clean up a class that had partially allocated resources before failing. However, referring to members of the failed object is considered undefined behavior since the object is “dead” before the catch block executes. This means that you can’t use function try to clean up after a class. If you want to clean up after a class, follow the standard rules for cleaning up classes that throw exceptions (see the “When constructor fail” subsection of lesson [20.5 -- Exceptions, classes, and inheritance](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/exceptions-classes-and-inheritance/)).

Function try is useful primarily for either logging failures before passing the exception up the stack, or for changing the type of exception thrown.
