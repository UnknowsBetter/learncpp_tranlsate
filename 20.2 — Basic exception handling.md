# 20.2 — Basic exception handling

In the previous lesson on [the need for exceptions](http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/151-the-need-for-exceptions/), we talked about how using return codes causes your control flow and error flow to be intermingled, constraining both. Exceptions in C++ are implemented using three keywords that work in conjunction with each other: **throw**, **try**, and **catch**.

C++中的异常是通过三个关键字组合实现的： throw, try, catch.

#### **Throwing exceptions**

We use signals all the time in real life to note that particular events have occurred. For example, during American football, if a player has committed a foul, the referee will throw a flag on the ground and whistle the play dead. A penalty is then assessed and executed. Once the penalty has been taken care of, play generally resumes as normal.

现实生活中，我们一直在使用信号表示一个特定的事件发生。举个栗子，在美国足球中，如果球员犯规，裁判将在地面上挥旗，并且吹哨。一个处罚开始评估执行。一旦处罚结束，游戏继续恢复进行。

In C++, a **throw statement** is used to signal that an exception or error case has occurred (think of throwing a penalty flag). Signaling that an exception has occurred is also commonly called **raising** an exception.

在C++中，一个throw语句表示一个异常发生。而发出异常信号的过程也叫作raising an exception。

To use a throw statement, simply use the throw keyword, followed by a value of any data type you wish to use to signal that an error has occurred. Typically, this value will be an error code, a description of the problem, or a custom exception class.

要使用throw语句的话，只需要在throw关键字后面跟一个任何你喜欢的类型的变量就行。通常来说，这个值可以是一个错误码，或者是问题描述，或是自定义的异常类。

Here are some examples:

```
throw -1; // throw a literal integer value
throw ENUM_INVALID_INDEX; // throw an enum value
throw "Can not take square root of negative number"; // throw a literal C-style (const char*) string
throw dX; // throw a double variable that was previously defined
throw MyException("Fatal Error"); // Throw an object of class MyException
```

Each of these statements acts as a signal that some kind of problem that needs to be handled has occurred.

上面的每一行语句都指示了一个特定的问题需要被处理。

#### **Looking for exceptions**

Throwing exceptions is only one part of the exception handling process. Let’s go back to our American football analogy: once a referee has thrown a penalty flag, what happens next? The players notice that a penalty has occurred and stop play. The normal flow of the football game is disrupted.

抛出异常只是异常处理的一部分，正常的执行流程被打断了。

In C++, we use the **try** keyword to define a block of statements (called a **try block**). The try block acts as an observer, looking for any exceptions that are thrown by any of the statements within the try block.

在C++中，我们用try来定义一个语句块，这个语句块就像一个观察者（足球裁判）一样，观察try块里面有没有任何语句抛出异常。

Here’s an example of a try block:

```
try
{
    // Statements that may throw exceptions you want to handle go here
    throw -1; // here's a trivial throw statement
}
```

Note that the try block doesn’t define HOW we’re going to handle the exception. It merely tells the program, “Hey, if any of the statements inside this try block throws an exception, grab it!”.

注意try块没有定义我们怎么处理异常，他仅仅是告诉程序，“hey，如果有任何的异常，就抓住他！”

#### **Handling exceptions**

Finally, the end of our American football analogy: After the penalty has been called and play has stopped, the referee assesses the penalty and executes it. In other words, the penalty must be handled before normal play can resume.

最后，结果和美国足球相似。捕获异常之后，就要开始执行异常的处理，处理结束之后，游戏继续。

Actually handling exceptions is the job of the catch block(s). The **catch** keyword is used to define a block of code (called a **catch block**) that handles exceptions for a single data type.

事实上处理异常的事情是catch块做的，catch关键字用来定义一个处理特定数据类型的语句块。

Here’s an example of a catch block that will catch integer exceptions:

这里是一个处理integer异常的例子

```
catch (int x)
{
    // Handle an exception of type int here
    std::cerr << "We caught an int exception with value" << x << '\n';
}
```

Try blocks and catch blocks work together -- A try block detects any exceptions that are thrown by statements within the try block, and routes them to the appropriate catch block for handling. A try block must have at least one catch block immediately following it, but may have multiple catch blocks listed in sequence.

try和catch搭配起来工作。一个try块检测异常，然后把异常交给合适的catch块来处理异常。一个try块后面必须紧跟着至少一个catch块，也可以跟着几个catch块。

Once an exception has been caught by the try block and routed to a catch block for handling, the exception is considered handled, and execution will resume as normal after the catch block.

一旦一个异常被try捕获，而且被交给了catch块。这个异常就被认为是已经处理了的。程序的执行会在catch块结束之后继续。

Catch parameters work just like function parameters, with the parameter being available within the subsequent catch block. Exceptions of fundamental types can be caught by value, but exceptions of non-fundamental types should be caught by const reference to avoid making an unnecessary copy.

Just like with functions, if the parameter is not going to be used in the catch block, the variable name can be omitted:

catch的参数有点像函数参数，有一个参数可以在后面的块中被使用。基本类型的异常可以用值拷贝，但是非基本类型的异常，应该通过引用来进行，避免不必要的拷贝。

就像函数参数一样，如果参数在块中不被使用的话，变量名也可以省略

```
catch (double) // note: no variable name since we don't use it in the catch block below
{
    // Handle exception of type double here
    std::cerr << "We caught an exception of type double" << '\n';
}
```

This can help prevent compiler warnings about unused variables.

这样可以阻止编译器抱怨有未使用的变量。

#### **Putting throw, try, and catch together**

Here’s a full program that uses throw, try, and multiple catch blocks:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    try
    {
        // Statements that may throw exceptions you want to handle go here
        throw -1; // here's a trivial example
    }
    catch (int x)
    {
        // Any exceptions of type int thrown within the above try block get sent here
        std::cerr << "We caught an int exception with value: " << x << '\n';
    }
    catch (double) // no variable name since we don't use the exception itself in the catch block below
    {
        // Any exceptions of type double thrown within the above try block get sent here
        std::cerr << "We caught an exception of type double" << '\n';
    }
    catch (const std::string &str) // catch classes by const reference
    {
        // Any exceptions of type std::string thrown within the above try block get sent here
        std::cerr << "We caught an exception of type std::string" << '\n';
    }
 
    std::cout << "Continuing on our merry way\n";
 
    return 0;
}
```

Running the above try/catch block would produce the following result:

```
We caught an int exception with value -1
Continuing on our merry way
```

A throw statement was used to raise an exception with the value -1, which is of type int. The throw statement was then caught by the enclosing try block, and routed to the appropriate catch block that handles exceptions of type int. This catch block printed the appropriate error message.

throw语句用来抛出异常。throw语句被try块包括的块作用域捕获，然后被try传递给合适的catch块，catch块再处理异常。在本例中catch块在屏幕上打印了适当的错误消息。

Once the exception was handled, the program continued as normal after the catch blocks, printing “Continuing on our merry way”.

一定异常被处理结束，程序会在catch块后面继续执行（try块内 throw之后的语句不会被执行）。

#### **Recapping exception handling**

Exception handling is actually quite simple, and the following two paragraphs cover most of what you need to remember about it:

异常处理相当简单，下面两段包含了大部分你需要记住的知识

When an exception is raised (using **throw**), execution of the program immediately jumps to the nearest enclosing **try** block (propagating up the stack if necessary to find an enclosing try block -- we’ll discuss this in more detail next lesson). If any of the **catch** handlers attached to the try block handle that type of exception, that handler is executed and the exception is considered handled.

异常被抛出之后，程序执行立即跳到最近的try块（传播到上一个函数值，如果在这个栈里面没有try块的话），如果任何紧跟着的catch块可以处理，那么这个catch块就被执行，异常被认为是被处理完成了。

If no appropriate catch handlers exist, execution of the program propagates to the next enclosing try block. If no appropriate catch handlers can be found before the end of the program, the program will fail with an exception error.

如果没有合适catch块存在的话，程序的执行会被传播到下一个try块（之前要求必须有一个catch块，现在说的是有catch块，但是不匹配），如果始终没有合适的catch块，程序会因为异常而终止。

Note that the compiler will not perform implicit conversions or promotions when matching exceptions with catch blocks! For example, a char exception will not match with an int catch block. An int exception will not match a float catch block. However, casts from a derived class to one of its parent classes will be performed.

注意编译器在匹配catch参数的时候，不会进行隐式类型转换。一个int异常不会匹配一个float catch块。然而，从派生类到基类的转换是会发生的。

That’s really all there is to it. The rest of this chapter will be dedicated to showing examples of these principles at work.

这就是全部了，本章下面的部分会注重展示一些例子。

#### **Exceptions are handled immediately**

异常被立即处理

Here’s a short program that demonstrates how exceptions are handled immediately:

```
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    try
    {
        throw 4.5; // throw exception of type double
        std::cout << "This never prints\n";
    }
    catch(double x) // handle exception of type double
    {
        std::cerr << "We caught a double of value: " << x << '\n';
    }
 
    return 0;
}
```

This program is about as simple as it gets. Here’s what happens: the throw statement is the first statement that gets executed -- this causes an exception of type double to be raised. Execution *immediately* moves to the nearest enclosing try block, which is the only try block in this program. The catch handlers are then checked to see if any handler matches. Our exception is of type double, so we’re looking for a catch handler of type double. We have one, so it executes.

这个程序很简单，throw语句执行，然后执行到了try块，try把异常交给了catch，catch对异常进行了处理，程序从catch之后继续进行。

Consequently, the result of this program is as follows:

```
We caught a double of value: 4.5
```

Note that “This never prints” is never printed, because the exception caused the execution path to jump immediately to the exception handler for doubles.

“This never prints” 从未被执行，是因为异常发生之后，程序的执行直接被交给了最近的异常处理过程。

#### **A more realistic example**

Let’s take a look at an example that’s not quite so academic:

```
#include "math.h" // for sqrt() function
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
    double x;
    std::cin >> x;
 
    try // Look for exceptions that occur within try block and route to attached catch block(s)
    {
        // If the user entered a negative number, this is an error condition
        if (x < 0.0)
            throw "Can not take sqrt of negative number"; // throw exception of type const char*
 
        // Otherwise, print the answer
        std::cout << "The sqrt of " << x << " is " << sqrt(x) << '\n';
    }
    catch (const char* exception) // catch exceptions of type const char*
    {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << exception << '\n';
    }
}
```

In this code, the user is asked to enter a number. If they enter a positive number, the if statement does not execute, no exception is thrown, and the square root of the number is printed. Because no exception is thrown in this case, the code inside the catch block never executes. The result is something like this:

在这段代码中，user被要求输入一个数字，如果是正数，if语句不会被执行。因为这里没有异常被抛出，所以catch块中的代码也从未被执行，结果如下：

```
Enter a number: 9
The sqrt of 9 is 3
```

If the user enters a negative number, we throw an exception of type const char*. Because we’re within a try block and a matching exception handler is found, control immediately transfers to the const char* exception handler. The result is:

如果用户输入一个负数，我们抛出的异常类型是const char，因为我们在try块里面，而且还有一个匹配的catch块，所以控制被传给了const char异常处理器，结果如下：

```
Enter a number: -4
Error: Can not take sqrt of negative number
```

By now, you should be getting the basic idea behind exceptions. In the next lesson, we’ll do quite a few more examples to show how flexible exceptions are.

现在的话，你应该知道异常背后的基本想法了。在下一节，我们会研究一些例子来表明异常可以有多灵活。

#### **What catch blocks typically do**

If an exception is routed to a catch block, it is considered “handled” even if the catch block is empty. However, typically you’ll want your catch blocks to do something useful. There are three common things that catch blocks do when they catch an exception:

如果异常被传给了catch块，即便catch块里面什么都不做，异常就被认为是处理过了。然而，通常你都会在catch块里面写点东西。下面有一些catch块经常会做的事情：

First, catch blocks may print an error (either to the console, or a log file).

第一打印一个错误到控制台或者日志文件

Second, catch blocks may return a value or error code back to the caller.

第二返回一个返回值或者错误码给调用函数

Third, a catch block may throw another exception. Because the catch block is outside of the try block, the newly thrown exception in this case is not handled by the preceding try block -- it’s handled by the next enclosing try block.

第三，一个catch块也可能抛出另一个异常，因为catch块在try块外面，所以新抛出的异常不会被前面的try块捕获，它会被下一个围住它的try块捕获（或者程序因为异常而终止）。
