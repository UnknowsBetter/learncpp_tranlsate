# 20.3 — Exceptions, functions, and stack unwinding

In the previous lesson on [basic exception handling](http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/152-basic-exception-handling/), we explained how throw, try, and catch work together to enable exception handling. In this lesson, we’ll talk about how exception handling interacts with functions.

在本节课程中，我们会谈论一下异常处理和函数调用怎么联系的

#### **Throwing exceptions outside of a try block**

In the examples in the previous lesson, the throw statements were placed directly within a try block. If this were a necessity, exception handling would be of limited use.

在前面的例子中，throw语句直接被放在了try块中，如果这样是强制性的话，那么异常处过程就会是有一定限制的。

One of the most useful properties of exception handling is that the throw statements do NOT have to be placed directly inside a try block due to the way exceptions propagate up the stack when thrown. This allows us to use exception handling in a much more modular fashion. We’ll demonstrate this by rewriting the square root program from the previous lesson to use a modular function.

异常处理的很有用的特点是，throw不一定要直接放在try块里面，因为异常在抛出的时候，会被沿着栈传播。这允许我们使用异常处理的方式更现代化。我们会做一个示例：

```
#include <cmath> // for sqrt() function
#include <iostream>
 
// A modular square root function
double mySqrt(double x)
{
    // If the user entered a negative number, this is an error condition
    if (x < 0.0)
        throw "Can not take sqrt of negative number"; // throw exception of type const char*
 
    return sqrt(x);
}
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
    double x;
    std::cin >> x;
 
    try // Look for exceptions that occur within try block and route to attached catch block(s)
    {
        double d = mySqrt(x);
        std::cout << "The sqrt of " << x << " is " << d << '\n';
    }
    catch (const char* exception) // catch exceptions of type const char*
    {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << exception << std::endl;
    }
 
    return 0;
}
```

In this program, we’ve taken the code that checks for an exception and calculates the square root and put it inside a modular function called mySqrt(). We’ve then called this mySqrt() function from inside a try block. Let’s verify that it still works as expected:

在这个程序中，我们已经在mySqrt函数中做了异常检查和正常的计算。我们在try块中调用这个mysqrt函数，让我们验证一下他是否还能满足我们的期待：

```
Enter a number: -4
Error: Can not take sqrt of negative number
```

It does!

它可以

Let’s revisit for a moment what happens when an exception is raised. First, the program looks to see if the exception can be handled immediately (which means it was thrown inside a try block). If not, the current function is terminated, and the program checks to see if the function’s caller will handle the exception. If not, it terminates the caller and checks the caller’s caller. Each function is terminated in sequence until a handler for the exception is found, or until main() is terminated without the exception being handled. This process is called **unwinding the stack** (see the lesson on [the stack and the heap](http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/79-the-stack-and-the-heap/) if you need a refresher on what the call stack is).

我们看一下异常抛出的时候发生了什么。程序先看一下这个throw是否能被直接捕获，如果不能的话，现在这个函数就终止，然后程序检查函数的调用者是否会捕获处理这个异常，如果不会的话，函数的调用者的执行也被终止，然后检查调用者的调用者是否对异常做了处理。每一个函数都会被终止，直到一个异常处理器被知道。或者main函数终止，异常也没有被处理。

这个过程叫做unwinding the stack栈展开。

Now, let’s take a detailed look at how that applies to this program when an exception is raised from within mySqrt(). First, the program checks to see if the exception was thrown from within a try block inside the function. In this case, it was not. Then, the stack begins to unwind. First, mySqrt() terminates, and control returns to main(). The program now checks to see if we’re inside a try block. We are, and there’s a const char* handler, so the exception is handled by the try block within main().

我们详细看一下发生在这里的是怎么回事。首先程序检查throw是否在一个try块中被抛出，在这个例子中，它不是。然后栈开始展开。首先mysqrt被中止，控制传回给main，然后程序开始检查现在是不是在一个try块中，在本例中确实在一个try块中，而且我们有一个const char*的 catch handler，所以程序在main中被处理。

To summarize, mySqrt() raised the exception, but the try/catch block in main() was the one who captured and handled the exception. Or, put another way, try blocks catch exceptions not only from statements within the try block, but also from functions that are called within the try block.

总结一下，mysqrt抛出了异常，但是在main中的try块才是那个捕获了异常的人。或者换句话说，try块不仅仅会捕获try块中的throw语句抛出的异常，也会捕获函数调用抛出的异常。

The most interesting part of the above program is that the mySqrt() function can throw an exception, but this exception is not immediately inside of a try block! This essentially means mySqrt is willing to say, “Hey, there’s a problem!”, but is unwilling to handle the problem itself. It is, in essence, delegating the responsibility for handling the exception to its caller (the equivalent of how using a return code passes the responsibility of handling an error back to a function’s caller).

上面最有趣的事情是mysqrt可以抛出一个异常，而这个异常没有立即在try块中被捕获。这实质上就是在说“这有一个问题“我解决不了。他把这个处理异常的责任委任给了调用者。

At this point, some of you are probably wondering why it’s a good idea to pass errors back to the caller. Why not just make MySqrt() handle its own error? The problem is that different applications may want to handle errors in different ways. A console application may want to print a text message. A windows application may want to pop up an error dialog. In one application, this may be a fatal error, and in another application it may not be. By passing the error back up the stack, each application can handle an error from mySqrt() in a way that is the most context appropriate for it! Ultimately, this keeps mySqrt() as modular as possible, and the error handling can be placed in the less-modular parts of the code.

在这里，你可能会问为什么把错误抛给调用者是一个好主意呢？为什么不自己处理呢？问题在于不同的应用程序想有不同的解决方式。一个控制台程序可能想打印一条信息，一个窗口程序可能想弹窗。在一个程序中这可能是一个致命错误，在另一个程序中可能不是。通过把错误向上传回，每一个调用了mysqrt的程序可以有自己的最合理的处理办法。最终，这使得mysqrt尽可能的**模块化**。错误处理可以放在没那么模块化的地方。

#### **Another stack unwinding example**

Here’s another example showing stack unwinding in practice, using a larger stack. Although this program is long, it’s pretty simple: main() calls first(), first() calls second(), second() calls third(), third() calls last(), and last() throws an exception.

再看一个例子：

```
#include <iostream>
 
void last() // called by third()
{
    std::cout << "Start last\n";
    std::cout << "last throwing int exception\n";
    throw -1;
    std::cout << "End last\n";
 
}
 
void third() // called by second()
{
    std::cout << "Start third\n";
    last();
    std::cout << "End third\n";
}
 
void second() // called by first()
{
    std::cout << "Start second\n";
    try
    {
        third();
    }
    catch(double)
    {
         std::cerr << "second caught double exception\n";
    }
    std::cout << "End second\n";
}
 
void first() // called by main()
{
    std::cout << "Start first\n";
    try
    {
        second();
    }
    catch (int)
    {
         std::cerr << "first caught int exception\n";
    }
    catch (double)
    {
         std::cerr << "first caught double exception\n";
    }
    std::cout << "End first\n";
}
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Start main\n";
    try
    {
        first();
    }
    catch (int)
    {
         std::cerr << "main caught int exception\n";
    }
    std::cout << "End main\n";
 
    return 0;
}
```

Take a look at this program in more detail, and see if you can figure out what gets printed and what doesn’t when it is run. The answer follows:

仔细看一下，看看你能不能找出来什么东西会被打印出来，什么东西不会被执行？

```
Start main
Start first
Start second
Start third
Start last
last throwing int exception
first caught int exception
End first
End main
```

Let’s examine what happens in this case. The printing of all the “Start” statements is straightforward and doesn’t warrant further explanation. Function last() prints “last throwing int exception” and then throws an int exception. This is where things start to get interesting.

我们看一下这里怎么回事，前面所有的Start语句都很简单，不需要解释。函数last打印说自己抛出了一个int异常，这是事情开始变得有趣的起点

Because last() doesn’t handle the exception itself, the stack begins to unwind. Function last() terminates immediately and control returns to the caller, which is third().

因为last不处理异常，所以栈开始展开，last被立即中止，程序控制交给了它的调用者

Function third() doesn’t handle any exceptions, so it terminates immediately and control returns to second().

third也没有处理任何异常，所以他也中止，控制交给了second

Function second() has a try block, and the call to third() is within it, so the program attempts to match the exception with an appropriate catch block. However, there are no handlers for exceptions of type int here, so second() terminates immediately and control returns to first(). Note that the integer exception is not implicitly converted to match the catch block handling a double.

second有一个try块，而且third调用也在try块的监视范围，所以程序开始去尝试匹配一个catch handler，但是这里没有匹配上，所以second也被立即中止，程序控制交还给first。注意的是integer异常不会做隐式类型转换变成一个double来强行匹配

Function first() also has a try block, and the call to second() is within it, so the program looks to see if there is a catch handler for int exceptions. There is! Consequently, first() handles the exception, and prints “first caught int exception”.

first也有一个try块，second调用也在其中。所以程序开始去匹配一个catch块，这里能匹配到，所以first把异常处理了，打印输出了内容。

Because the exception has now been handled, control continues normally at the end of the catch block within first(). This means first() prints “End first” and then terminates normally.

因为异常现在被处理了，所以控制在异常处理结束后，继续恢复正常执行了。

Control returns to main(). Although main() has an exception handler for int, our exception has already been handled by first(), so the catch block within main() does not get executed. main() simply prints “End main” and then terminates normally.

控制返回给了main，尽管main有一个异常处理器，我们的异常已经被first处理了，所以在main中的catch块就没有执行。

There are quite a few interesting principles illustrated by this program:

这个例子中表明了几件值得注意的原则：

First, the immediate caller of a function that throws an exception doesn’t have to handle the exception if it doesn’t want to. In this case, third() didn’t handle the exception thrown by last(). It delegated that responsibility to one of its callers up the stack.

首先，一个调用了抛出异常的函数的调用者没有必要处理这个异常，如果他不想处理的话，它可以把异常抛给它的调用者来处理这个异常

Second, if a try block doesn’t have a catch handler for the type of exception being thrown, stack unwinding occurs just as if there were no try block at all. In this case, second() didn’t handle the exception either because it didn’t have the right kind of catch block.

第二，如果一个try块找不到handler能处理当前异常的话，栈就马上展开，就好像是那么没有一个try块一样。

Third, once an exception is handled, control flow proceeds as normal starting from the end of the catch blocks. This was demonstrated by first() handling the error and then terminating normally. **By the time the program got back to main(), the exception had been thrown and handled already -- main() had no idea there even was an exception at all!**

第三，一旦异常被处理之后，控制流从异常处理过程的结束开始继续向前。

As you can see, stack unwinding provides us with some very useful behavior -- if a function does not want to handle an exception, it doesn’t have to. The exception will propagate up the stack until it finds someone who will! This allows us to decide where in the call stack is the most appropriate place to handle any errors that may occur.

正如你所看到的那样，栈展开提供给我们很多有用的东西。**如果一个函数不想处理异常，他就可以不处理异常。然后这个异常就会向上传播（或者没能力处理异常，没有对应的catch块），直到找到一个有能力处理异常的catch块，或者因为不能处理异常而程序终止。**

In the next lesson, we’ll take a look at what happens when you don’t capture an exception, and a method to prevent that from happening.
